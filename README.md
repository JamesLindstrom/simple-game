# Space Aggregator

A simple game that runs in the browser.

I made this game as a coding exercise to create something novel from scratch. To run it, download the repository and open index.html in the browser. JavaScript must be enabled. Some older browsers not run the game.

I created the code, images, sounds, and music of Space Aggregator, and it and its assets are copyright &copy; 2020 James Lindstrom. All rights reserved.
